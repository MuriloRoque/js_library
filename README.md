## Built With

- JavaScript
- HTML5 
- CSS3

## Requirements

- Keep your code clean.
- Do not commit console.log to your repo. - It‚Äôs ugly, it kills performance and it can make confidential data be visible in the browser tools.
- Keep the number of changes/updates to the DOM as low as possible, they are very expensive for the browser.
- Keep the application logic separated from DOM manipulation tasks.
- Keep all the styling logic in CSS files.
If you use node modules 
- lock files should be in the repository to avoid problems with future versions of the dependencies.
If you use ES6 
- use object destructuring to get the values from an object. This way you can avoid repeating a lot of code.

### Setup

- Clone the repository on your local machine
- Cd into the folder
- Open index.html file

### Install

- Install VSCode or any code editor you like
